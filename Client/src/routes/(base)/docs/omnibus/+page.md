This Omnibus is intended to act as a set of guidelines and rules to help guide both site users and staff on what content Offprint allows, and with which ratings, warnings, and licensing.

Please note that while there is and will always be some leeway in regards to these rules, intentionally trying to skirt or work around any restrictions is not allowed.

## Work Approval

All works that are published to Offprint must go through an approval process. Currently this is a manual process taken up by our Work Approvers.

The approval process will ensure that a work meets the expectations and guidelines of the omnibus. Small problems may simply be asked to be edited, such as missing content warnings or being assigned to an incorrect category. Larger infractions and breaking of rules will see a work rejected, though they may be re-submitted if they are appropriately edited.

A work that fails the approval process a total of 3 times may not be re-submitted for approval.

## Language & Writing Quality
All works published must be written primarily in English, and be of at least a minimum quality, i.e. feature minimal typos, decent grammar, have proper punctuation and be split into paragraphs. As a general rule of thumb, everything must be up to at least the standard of high school English.

Proper nouns like the names of people or places that are not in English are allowed, as are borrowed words and phrases like 'déjà vu' and 'schadenfreude'.

All works must be a minimum of 750 words to be published, with the exception of Poetry.

Blogs are largely exempt from the above rules, though must still be written in English.

## Categorisation, Genre, & Kinds of Works
All works should be properly categorised into either original works of fan-fiction. Additionally, fan-fiction should also have appropriate tags for the works it derives from, i.e. a story set in Equestria about Twilight Sparkle and her friends should be tagged as “My Little Pony”. If the work is a large crossover, consider what IPs are most prominent.

Works should be given appropriate genres. If a work fits into more than three, again consider which genres are most prominent.

Works are also split into ‘kinds’ and should be labelled with whichever is appropriate. The options are:
* Prose
* Poetry
* Nonfiction
* Scripts
* Anthologies

## Categorisation

All works must be appropriately categorised and tagged.
* Works must be appropriately categorised and tagged, i.e. fan-fiction categorised as a fan-work and added to the original work’s tag, or original works tagged to appropriate genres.
* Works must be given an appropriate rating depending on their content.
* Where applicable, works should contain appropriate content warnings.

You may not circumvent categorisation and approvals by posting works as Blogs. If you are found to be doing this, the offending blogs will be swiftly removed.

## Ratings

This is an overview of the different ratings what is allowed with them. Many of these things are expanded on further in the omnibus.
* Everyone: Suitable for all audiences. Swearing, sexual themes, and anything more than cartoon violence are not allowed.
* Teen: Suitable for teenagers and above. Teen rated works can feature mildly adult themes, such as mild violence and limited course language. They cannot feature sexual acts or gratuitous violence.
* Mature: Suitable only for adults. Heavier usage of violence is allowed, as well as more detail descriptions of gore. While sex can be comfortably mentioned, explicit depiction of sex and sexual activities are not allowed.
* Explicit: Suitable only for adults. Explicit rated stories can feature explicit depiction of sex and sexual activity, though are not exclusively pornographic/erotic.

## Content Warnings

Works featuring shocking content and sexual content are required to come with appropriate content warnings. It is also recommended, but not a requirement, that other common triggers also have warnings. All warnings must be concise and clear and should not be vague. This does not mean you must make an exhaustive list.

Some examples of content warnings are:
* Depictions of blood, gore, and violence
* Depictions of sex and sexual content
* References to and consumption of alcohol or drugs
* Usage of harsh and strong language, including usage of slurs
* Depictions of discrimination & hate

## Ownership of Works

### Original Works

Unless otherwise stated by yourself, all original non-fan/non-derivative works you publish to Offprint are considered to be your own. You are welcome and encouraged to take advantage of Creative Commons licensing.

Any original work that is published without a license will be treated by Offprint as public domain (such as for the purpose of derivative works) until such a time as you decide to give it a license.

### Fan, Derivative & Transformative Works

Unless otherwise stated by yourself, Offprint considers all fan, derivative and transformative works you publish to Offprint to be your own. However, if they are directly related to any IP or licensed work that is not in the public domain at the time of publication, you might not be able to license it as your own. In those cases, check the rights and permissions given by the original license holders.

### Plagiarism

Plagiarism is the act of publishing others' work as your own, and is prohibited. This includes complete copies of work that is not your own, and copies that have been mildly altered to swap small details such as names or descriptions but is still recognisable as the original work. Exceptions are made where the original author has given explicit permission.

### Re-uploading removed content

* Content that was removed by staff cannot be re-uploaded without prior staff approval.
* Content that was removed by other users cannot be re-uploaded without their explicit consent.

## Real World Individuals & Real Person Fiction (RPF)

* Works that focus on any real, living person are prohibited, unless you have explicit permission. This includes everyone from celebrities to other site users. Works featuring deceased persons, assuming they are not recently deceased, ar allowed.
* Should staff find reasonable doubt in that consent, or that consent has been revoked, the work will be removed.
* Fanfiction of stories focusing on real people that have been fictionalised may be allowed, but must be written to reflect the fictionalised representation.
* Mentions of real people and minor appearances (cameos) are allowed if that person does not play a significant role in the story.

## Illegal Content

Any works and blogs posted must contain nothing illegal in the United States of America or the State of California. As a rule of thumb, if it pertains to real world media piracy or real world prohibited content, it is prohibited on Offprint.

## Hateful Content, Bigotry, & Usage of Slurs

* Works that are seen to promote hate against real world people or groups are prohibited. This includes but is not limited to:
    * LGBTQ+ groups and individuals
    * Groups and individuals of specific ethnicities and races
    * Disabled groups and individuals
    * Religion, Religious groups and individuals
* Uncritical and positive usage of slurs is prohibited.
* Usage of fantasy slurs are allowed, i.e. Knife Ears, Clankers, but will come under scrutiny if believed to reference real world groups and individuals.

## Adult Themes & NSFW Content

### Sexual Content featuring Minors

* All characters featured in explicit sexual or fetishized contexts must be 18 and over.
* Aged up characters will come under scrutiny, as will any ‘adult’ characters with child-like appearances and/or mannerisms.
* Acknowledging minors were involved in a sexual context is allowed, but still prohibited from being shown.
* Content that encourages pedophilia is prohibited, regardless of rating.

### Incest

* Any depictions of incest are only allowed in works rated Teen and above.
* Positive depictions of incest involving minors are prohibited.
* Depictions of incest as an exploration of abuse are allowed.
* Depictions of incest between consenting adult siblings or cousins are allowed.

### Rape, Non-con & Dub-con (Non-Consent & Dubious Consent)

* Depictions of rape in romanticised or pornographic contexts are prohibited.
* Depictions of rape in other circumstances, i.e. exploring the consequences or part of a larger story are allowed, but will be under additional scrutiny.
* Dub-con will also be closely scrutinised, and attempts to label non-con as dub-con are prohibited.

## Cover Art & Banners

Works do not need to have a cover or banner, but it is encouraged.

You must include credit to the original creator of a work’s cover art or banner. Links are much preferred, where possible.

‘Violent’ images can only be used for works and blogs rated Teen and above. ‘Suggestive’ images can only be used for works and blogs rated Mature and Explicit.

Cover art and banners cannot include:
* Explicit depictions of death or gore. Some violence is okay.
* Nudity of any sort, i.e. visible genitals, nipples, or anus, with the exception of ‘barbie doll’ anatomy.
* Depiction of sexual fluids, i.e. any excretions from the genitals, nipples, or anus.
* Focus on clothed or unclothed body parts that are considered ‘sexual’, such as breasts, groins, or buttocks.

## Links to Other Sites
Links to other sites are fine as long as the content therein is not illegal. That said, please do not post links to anything NSFW in your profile’s links, the short description for works, or the description for blogs.

## Use of AI

Use of Generative AI, Machine Learning Algorithms, or similar within your works is disallowed. Works that are found to have used any sort of AI will be rejected/removed. This includes the use for editing beyond spell checking and proofreading.
